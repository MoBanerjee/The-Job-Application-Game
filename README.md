The Job Application Game™: Because Regular Job Applications aren't Annoying Enough

Are you tired of bland, uninspired job applications? Do you want to experience the thrill of applying for a job while battling quirky requirements and ridiculous logic? The Job Application Game™—where your skills, creativity, and sanity will be put to the ultimate test!

🧐 What's This About?

This is no ordinary job application form. It's a fun (and mildly absurd) interactive game that will challenge you to:

1. Fill out a job application riddled with quirky rules.
2. Validate yourself against arbitrary standards.
3. Laugh at rejection because, honestly, it's inevitable here.

Designed for anyone who loves React and has ever cried over rejection emails, this project is a parody of the modern job application process, with a sprinkle of humor and a dash of frustration.

🎯 The Rules (AKA What You Signed Up For)

Each step has unique and sometimes absurd requirements:

1. The Basics: Enter your name, email, and an "I-less" introduction. (Because there's no "I" in "team.")
2. Your Journey: Prove your worth with a Fortune 500 employer, valid HTML experience, and the perfect phone number.
3. Teamwork Rhymes: Compose a rhyming ode to teamwork. Shakespeare would be proud.
4. Real Talk: Log your rejection count, coffee chats, and some painfully funny numbers.
5. Money Talks: Set a 5-digit salary with Fibonacci-like logic.
6. The Finale: Submit your application only to face the hilarious rejection screen. (It's tradition.)
